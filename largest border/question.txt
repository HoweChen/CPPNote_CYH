Given a N 2 chessboard and we use block(r1,c1,r2,c2) to indicate a rectangular sub-region from coordinate (r1,c1) to (r2,c2). In this chessboard, there are some sub-regions are already occupied and your tasks is to find the size of the largest free rectangular sub- region in the chessboard.

For instance, block(2,2,5,3), block(8,3,9,7), and block(3,6,3,8) are already occupied. The size of the largest sub-region is 28 (shaded by the black color in the following figure).
